# Description
This is a react.js version of Netflix clone webpage.
Most code comes from [this lecture](http://global.ironhack.com/course/learn-html-css-by-cloning-netflix-spotify-amazon).
I made this because source code repository that the lecturer provided is unavailable.
I changed the original code to work with React.JS. I changed JQuery-based code to vanila JS code.
Some text is written in Korean. I don't think they bother you to understand the code.

# How to run
1. npm install
2. npm start
